# âš½ Football Match Prediction

This project builds a **classification model** to predict the result of football matches using **historical match data** and **player performance data**. The project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data preprocessing**, and **K-Fold cross-validation** to improve model performance.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict football match outcomes (Win, Lose, Draw) using historical data.
- **Techniques:** 
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Data Preprocessing (Handling missing data, feature engineering)
    - Classification Modeling (Logistic Regression or other models)
    - K-Fold Cross Validation (Model Evaluation)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files

| File/Folder      | Description |
|------------------|--------------|
| `LogisticRegression_Football_Data.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with full EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation pipeline |
| `data/`      | Folder for historical match/player data (optional) |
| `README.md`      | Project documentation (this file) |

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Modeling & Evaluation)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Place your dataset (CSV file) in the `data/` folder if needed.
3. Open `LogisticRegression_Football_Data.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## ðŸ“Š Example Output

- Input: Historical match data with team stats, player stats, and match context.
- Output: Predicted match result (Win, Lose, Draw).

---

## ðŸ“– Future Work

- Test more advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Add more features (weather, injuries, manager history).
- Deploy as a web application to predict upcoming matches.
